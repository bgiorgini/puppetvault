===========

Let's  start with some preseed files for debian-like oses.

This preseed files automate the install of virtual machines
ready to use with puppet.

The intention of this repository is to store puppet repository
while reading the book, Pro Puppet, 2nd edition.

Let's have some fun.

Preseed was good but Vagrant is better. Now we are going to use Vagrant.

puppetvault
===========

The intention of this repository is to store puppet repository
while reading the book, Pro Puppet, 2nd edition.

Use

  vagrant up

To set up the environment. 

Let's have some fun.

Old Stuff
=========

Let's  start with some preseed files for debian-like oses.

This preseed files automate the install of virtual machines
ready to use with puppet.

I'm no longer using the upstart method as vagrant is much faster.
